<p class="Bord">
When computers with large memories became available around 1970, researchers from all three traditions began to build knowledge into AI applications.
This "knowledge revolution" led to the development and deployment of expert systems (introduced by Edward Feigenbaum), the first truly successful form of AI software.
The knowledge revolution was also driven by the realization that enormous amounts of knowledge would be required by many simple AI applications.
